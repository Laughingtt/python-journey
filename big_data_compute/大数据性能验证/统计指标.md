好的，为了进一步增加计算复杂度，我们可以使用窗口函数、联接（JOIN）等更复杂的SQL查询。以下是一些包含窗口函数和联接的大规模计算指标SQL示例。

### 1. 每个用户的每日交易总额及其在所有用户中的排名

```sql
SELECT
    user_id,
    transaction_date,
    daily_total_amount,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY transaction_date ORDER BY daily_total_amount DESC) AS user_daily_rank
FROM (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        DATE(transaction_time) AS transaction_date,
        SUM(amount) AS daily_total_amount
    FROM
        transactions
    GROUP BY
        user_id, DATE(transaction_time)
) AS user_daily_totals
ORDER BY
    transaction_date, user_daily_rank;
```

### 2. 每个商品在不同用户中的购买次数和总金额，以及它们的排名

```sql
SELECT
    product_id,
    user_id,
    purchase_count,
    total_spent,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY total_spent DESC) AS spending_rank
FROM (
    SELECT
        product_id,
        user_id,
        COUNT(transaction_id) AS purchase_count,
        SUM(amount) AS total_spent
    FROM
        transactions
    GROUP BY
        product_id, user_id
) AS product_user_totals
ORDER BY
    product_id, spending_rank;
```

### 3. 用户与其推荐好友的购买行为比较

假设有一个用户推荐好友关系表`user_friends`，包含字段`user_id`和`friend_id`。

```sql
-- 计算用户的总购买金额
WITH user_totals AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        SUM(amount) AS total_spent
    FROM
        transactions
    GROUP BY
        user_id
),
-- 计算好友的总购买金额
friend_totals AS (
    SELECT
        uf.user_id AS user_id,
        SUM(t.amount) AS friends_total_spent
    FROM
        user_friends uf
        JOIN transactions t ON uf.friend_id = t.user_id
    GROUP BY
        uf.user_id
)
SELECT
    ut.user_id,
    ut.total_spent,
    ft.friends_total_spent,
    (ut.total_spent - ft.friends_total_spent) AS spending_difference
FROM
    user_totals ut
    LEFT JOIN friend_totals ft ON ut.user_id = ft.user_id
ORDER BY
    spending_difference DESC;
```

### 4. 每个用户每月的平均交易金额及其在所有用户中的排名

```sql
SELECT
    user_id,
    year,
    month,
    average_monthly_amount,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY year, month ORDER BY average_monthly_amount DESC) AS monthly_rank
FROM (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        YEAR(transaction_time) AS year,
        MONTH(transaction_time) AS month,
        AVG(amount) AS average_monthly_amount
    FROM
        transactions
    GROUP BY
        user_id, YEAR(transaction_time), MONTH(transaction_time)
) AS user_monthly_averages
ORDER BY
    year, month, monthly_rank;
```

### 5. 每个商品在不同区域的销售情况及其排名

假设有一个商品销售区域表`product_regions`，包含字段`product_id`和`region_id`。

```sql
-- 计算商品在各区域的销售总额和次数
WITH product_region_sales AS (
    SELECT
        pr.product_id,
        pr.region_id,
        COUNT(t.transaction_id) AS sales_count,
        SUM(t.amount) AS total_sales_amount
    FROM
        product_regions pr
        JOIN transactions t ON pr.product_id = t.product_id
    GROUP BY
        pr.product_id, pr.region_id
)
SELECT
    product_id,
    region_id,
    sales_count,
    total_sales_amount,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY total_sales_amount DESC) AS region_sales_rank
FROM
    product_region_sales
ORDER BY
    product_id, region_sales_rank;
```

### 6. 计算过去30天的滑动窗口累计交易金额

```sql
SELECT
    transaction_time,
    SUM(amount) OVER (ORDER BY transaction_time ROWS BETWEEN 30 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS rolling_30_day_total
FROM
    transactions
ORDER BY
    transaction_time;
```
